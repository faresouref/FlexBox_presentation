# Flex Box Property Project

This project demonstrates the use of Flexbox layout model using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to interactively change the layout of a container using different Flexbox properties such as `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-direction`.

## Files Included

1. **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure of the project.
2. **style.css**: Includes the styles for the HTML elements.
3. **main.js**: Contains the JavaScript code for handling button clicks and updating Flexbox properties dynamically.

## HTML Structure

- The HTML file (`index.html`) includes a `container` div with several child `item` divs representing flex items.
- Buttons are provided to control `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-direction`.

## CSS Styles

- CSS (`style.css`) is used for styling HTML elements, including setting up the layout, colors, and appearance.
- Flexbox properties such as `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-direction` are defined here.

## JavaScript Interactivity

- JavaScript (`main.js`) is used to handle button clicks.
- Event listeners are added to each button to dynamically update the Flexbox properties of the container based on user input.
